# Screen Manager

The **Screen Manager** is a component included on every TXL video player prefab by default.  It is responsible for 
everything related to **materials** and **rendering** video on surfaces, and it's responsible for managing any
placeholder textures when video isn't actively playing.

A Screen Manager object is given a TXL video player to bind to at start.  In advanced setups, it's possible to run
a video player without a screen manager if no rendering is required, assign a screen manager to another video player,
or have multiple managers working from a single video player.
